[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg?style=flat-square)](LICENSE.txt)

`CakePHP 4.x` plugin that dinamically adds auto-generated Swagger documentation to your projects using `swagger-php` and `swagger-ui 3.x`

## Requirements

* CakePHP 4.0+
* Some [swagger-php](https://github.com/zircote/swagger-php) annotation knowledge

## Installation

1. Install the plugin using composer:

    ```bash
    composer require devin345458/cake-swagger:dev-master
    ```

2. To enable the plugin either run the following command:

    ```bash
    bin/cake plugin load CakeSwagger
    ```

    or manually add the following line to your `config/bootstrap.php` file:

    ```bash
    Application::load('CakeSwagger');
    ```

3. Create the configuration file `/config/cake-swagger.php` if not exists. See #Configuration section

4. Browsing to `http://your_app_uri/api/ui` should now produce the
[Swagger-UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) interface:

    ![Default UI index](http://2434zd29misd3e4a4f1e73ki.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/swagger-UI-e1491843286926.png)

## Configuration

All configuration for this plugin is done through the `/config/cake-swagger.php`
configuration file. Full example below.

	'CakeSwagger' => [
		'ui' => [
			'title' => 'CakePHP Swagger plugin'
		],
		'route' => [
			'path' => '/api'
